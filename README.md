# All-Zip-Files-Here
Here are my project zip files. They're messy but I keep them around to help me see my progress. I've also included some files that I have reinterpreted from other Github users as a way for me to have reference of some of their code that I've personally enjoyed learning from. In those projects I have linked the Github of the original creators. Many thanks to my professors, teammates and Github users for teaching me so much!
